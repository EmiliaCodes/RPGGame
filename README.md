# RPGGame
This repository consist of a RPG game in C#. It was a part of a group project, which was simulating creating a complicated project based on documentation and code review.

- My job was to **design and code some monsters, items, skills and interactions (quests).**
- It was a good practice of **object-oriented programming paradigm**
- Some **design patterns** were applied

Files are grouped into two main folders - Engine and MyFiles. Monsters, items, skills and interactions made by me were tested and merged into the game, but for now they are separated - you can expect me updating this repository to upload fully merged version here as well.

More documentation (operating manual, documentation for my files) is coming - stay tuned!
